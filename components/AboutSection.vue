    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      Paradnight Studio is a small indie game studio. I (Rodrigo) do most of the design
      and programming work, but I usually collaborate with Andrea Baroni, composer and
      sound designer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea behind the studio is to create weird, horror and/or retro inspired games.
      But not limited to that, as we don't know what ideas lurk in our brains.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you like our games, leaving a review on Steam or itch.io would make a huge
      difference to this minuscule studio!
